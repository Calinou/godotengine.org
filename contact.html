  <h2>Support</h2>
  <p>
    If you have a problem learning Godot or need help, please first
    <a href="/community.html">contact the community</a> or file an issue at
    <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot">GitHub</a>. Godot developers
    are busy working in making Godot better, so they can't always answer
    questions. They will, however, be glad to assist you if you can't get an
    answer from conventional means.
  </p>
  <h2>Commercial Support</h2>
  <p>
    While we still don't have a formal structure for offering commercial
    support, many Godot developers can already help you, work per hour, or
    relocate to your company. For such inquiries, contact
    <a href="mailto:support@godotengine.org">support@godotengine.org</a>. Just
    let us know about your needs and we'll try to find the right person for you.
  </p>
  <h2>General Inquiries</h2>
  <p>
    For other inquiries such as business, education, non-profit, promotion, etc.
    Contact <a href="contact@godotengine.org">contact@godotengine.org</a>.
